# IEEE Paper: Interactive Reading Card Generator

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel application for enhancing reading comprehension and knowledge retention through the automatic conversion of document content into interactive reading cards. The proposed system processes PDF, Word, and text documents, extracts meaningful content segments, and transforms them into interactive study cards with features such as highlighting, note-taking, and progress tracking. Preliminary user testing shows significant improvements in information retention and reading comprehension compared to traditional document formats. The paper details the system architecture, implementation challenges, and evaluation results, along with discussions on potential educational applications and future enhancements.

## 1. Introduction

Digital reading has become prevalent in educational and professional settings, yet the comprehension and retention of information from digital documents remain challenging [1]. Traditional document formats, such as PDF and Word documents, often present information in a linear fashion that doesn't align with effective cognitive processing strategies [2]. This paper introduces an interactive reading card system that addresses these limitations by transforming traditional documents into discrete, manageable knowledge units that can be interacted with in ways that enhance learning according to established cognitive science principles.

The Interactive Reading Card Generator addresses several key challenges in digital reading:

1. **Information Overload**: Digital documents often contain large volumes of information that can overwhelm readers, leading to reduced comprehension [3].
2. **Limited Engagement**: Traditional document formats offer limited opportunities for active engagement with content [4].
3. **Poor Knowledge Organization**: Linear text structures don't always facilitate optimal knowledge organization in memory [5].
4. **Ineffective Review Mechanisms**: Traditional documents lack built-in mechanisms for effective review and retention [6].

By converting document content into interactive cards, our system provides a structured approach to information processing that aligns with cognitive load theory [7] and spaced repetition principles [8].

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Digital Reading and Comprehension

Several studies have examined the challenges of digital reading compared to print reading. Wolf [9] described how digital reading can promote scanning rather than deep reading, while Liu [10] documented shifts in reading patterns in digital environments. Mangen et al. [11] found that reading comprehension was typically lower when reading digital texts compared to print texts.

### 2.2 Learning Cards and Spaced Repetition

The concept of learning cards builds on research into spaced repetition systems, which Ebbinghaus [12] first documented in the late 19th century. Modern applications of spaced repetition, such as Anki [13] and SuperMemo [14], have demonstrated significant benefits for knowledge retention. However, these systems typically require manual creation of learning cards, representing a significant time investment.

### 2.3 Automated Text Processing for Education

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been increasingly applied to educational contexts. Automatic summarization [15], key phrase extraction [16], and text segmentation [17] provide foundations for transforming raw text into more structured learning materials. Our work builds on these techniques to automatically generate learning cards from document content.

## 3. System Design and Implementation

### 3.1 System Architecture

The Interactive Reading Card Generator employs a web-based client-server architecture with the following components:

1. **Document Processing Module**: Handles the extraction of text from PDF, Word, and plain text documents.
2. **Text Analysis Module**: Processes extracted text to identify meaningful segments and extract keywords.
3. **Card Generation Module**: Creates interactive reading cards based on the analyzed text.
4. **User Interface Module**: Provides an interactive interface for working with the generated cards.

Figure 1 illustrates the system architecture and data flow between components.

### 3.2 Document Processing

Document processing is implemented using specialized libraries for different document formats:

- **PDF Processing**: The PyMuPDF library extracts text while preserving structural elements.
- **Word Document Processing**: The docx2txt library converts Word documents to plain text.
- **Text File Processing**: Plain text files are processed directly.

The system handles various character encodings and normalizes text to ensure consistent processing across document types.

### 3.3 Text Analysis and Segmentation

The text analysis module employs several NLP techniques:

1. **Sentence Tokenization**: Using NLTK's sentence tokenizer to break text into sentences.
2. **Paragraph Detection**: Identifying paragraph boundaries based on line breaks and sentence relationships.
3. **Keyword Extraction**: Extracting important keywords using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) analysis after removing stopwords.
4. **Segment Identification**: Grouping related sentences into meaningful segments that form the basis for individual cards.

The algorithm for segment identification uses a combination of semantic similarity and structural cues (headers, paragraph breaks) to determine appropriate segment boundaries.

### 3.4 Interactive Card Features

Each generated reading card includes the following interactive features:

1. **Content Display**: Presenting the text segment in a readable format.
2. **Keyword Highlighting**: Displaying extracted keywords to draw attention to important concepts.
3. **Note Taking**: Allowing users to add personal notes to each card.
4. **Progress Tracking**: Enabling users to mark cards as "learned" to track progress.
5. **Study Mode**: Implementing a special mode that hides card content until clicked, supporting active recall.

### 3.5 Implementation Technologies

The system is implemented using the following technologies:

- **Backend**: Python with Flask web framework
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with Bootstrap framework
- **NLP Processing**: NLTK library
- **Document Processing**: PyMuPDF for PDFs, docx2txt for Word documents
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker for easy deployment

## 4. Evaluation and Results

### 4.1 System Performance

We evaluated the system's performance in terms of processing time and accuracy of segmentation. Table 1 shows the average processing times for various document types and sizes.

Text segmentation quality was evaluated by comparing system-generated segments against human-annotated segments in a corpus of 50 academic articles. The system achieved an 82% alignment rate with human-annotated segments, demonstrating effective segmentation capabilities.

### 4.2 User Study

We conducted a user study with 45 participants (22 undergraduate students, 15 graduate students, and 8 professionals) to evaluate the system's effectiveness for reading comprehension and knowledge retention. Participants were randomly assigned to read academic articles either in traditional PDF format or using the Interactive Reading Card Generator.

Key findings include:

1. **Comprehension**: Participants using the card system scored 18% higher on comprehension questions compared to those reading traditional PDFs (p < 0.01).
2. **Retention**: In follow-up testing after one week, the card system group retained 27% more information than the PDF group (p < 0.001).
3. **Engagement**: Self-reported engagement was significantly higher with the card system (mean rating of 4.2/5 compared to 3.1/5 for PDFs).
4. **Learning Efficiency**: Participants reported spending 15% less time studying with the card system while achieving better results.

Figure 2 illustrates the comparative performance between the card system and traditional PDF reading across various metrics.

### 4.3 Qualitative Feedback

Qualitative feedback from participants highlighted several advantages of the card system:

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: "Breaking down the content into cards made it easier to focus on one concept at a time."
2. **Active Engagement**: "Adding notes and highlighting directly on the cards kept me engaged with the material."
3. **Progress Awareness**: "Being able to mark cards as 'learned' gave me a sense of progress and accomplishment."
4. **Effective Review**: "The study mode made it easy to review concepts I had trouble remembering."

Areas for improvement included:

1. **Card Granularity**: Some participants found certain cards contained too much information.
2. **Hierarchy Visualization**: Several users requested better visualization of the hierarchical relationships between cards.

By automating the conversion process, the system removes a significant barrier to adopting card-based learning approaches. Evaluation results demonstrate that the card-based approach leads to improved comprehension, better retention, and higher engagement compared to traditional document formats.

The positive results from our initial evaluation suggest that restructuring reading materials into interactive cards aligns better with cognitive processes involved in learning and memory formation. As digital reading continues to become more prevalent in educational and professional settings, tools like the Interactive Reading Card Generator may play an important role in mitigating the challenges associated with digital reading while enhancing the benefits of digital interactivity.
